## Implementation
### Prio tasks
* Lukas: 1.1 (in progress) + 1.3 (done - how shall it be generated ) 
* Lucas: 1.2 + 1.4
* in the game elements in the following method is encapsulation broken:
	<b> protected boolean canCollect(Player player) {
		return player.isInPos(this.x, this.y);
	} </b> --> I have removed it but we still should check the code for things like that

####
* Questions (Task 1.1):
* How do we want to generate the wall
* how shall it revice a demage and give coins back when it is destroyed?
*
