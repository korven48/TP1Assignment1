# TODO
## Implementation
* ResetCommand.java has to be modified (only one command should exist)
* Reset method in the Game has to be modified
* The methods from the GameElementGenerator have to be implemented 
* The GameElementGenerator have to be integrated in the other classes
* We have to modify the visibility of some classes and methods 
* Maybe we should put the coins and obstacles and the Factory to an subpackage?
* How do we implement the factory the best?
* GameElementContainer could be implemented with ArrayList instead of array

## Test failing
* <b>Easy_s100_2:</b>
- the [DEBUG] Executing: t is missing
- The last <b>total coins</b> have the wrong out put
* <b>Easy_s666_0:</b>
- The [DEBUG] Executing: is wronge
- In the last line the game is printed
* <b>Easy_s666_1:</b>
- In the first printed line the ecexute command is not printed
* <b>hard_s100_4</b>
- total coin at the end is not matching
- the hand has to much line space
* <b>test_s100_3</b>
- Basiclly okay but still to much line feed at the end
