# TODO
## Implementation
* ResetCommand.java has to be modified (only one command should exist)
* Reset method in the Game has to be modified
* The methods from the GameElementGenerator have to be implemented 
* The GameElementGenerator have to be integrated in the other classes
* We have to modify the visibility of some classes and methods 
* Maybe we should put the coins and obstacles and the Factory to an subpackage?
* How do we implement the factory the best?
* GameElementContainer could be implemented with ArrayList instead of array
